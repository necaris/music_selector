## music selector

Toy application to select random music from my music library with which to
fill a limited space on devices such as my iPod, phone or tablet. Originally
written to solve a problem, now often used as a sample app to learn a new
language or toolkit.

Implementations:
* Python (3.x) (reference)
* Go
* Node.js (coming soon)
* Rust (coming soon)
